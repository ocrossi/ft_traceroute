## Libft

The libft is the 1st project of the 42 Cursus. It initiates the students with the basic C programming functions (string and list manipulation for the biggest part).
It is then being used in each C programming project of the school, since the C library standard functions recoded here are forbidden for most projects. It is updated with some of the tools i used for other projects (print memory etc)

## Printf

This is the same pattern as for the lib, this subject requires the students to copy the behavior of an existing function, here printf.

## Get_next_line

This function is about reading a file line per line. It is a short program very useful for the rest of the C cursus.
